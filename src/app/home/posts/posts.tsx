            that 'overseas' album i hinted at in my last post drops this friday. making it has been a trip and i'm really really excited for it to be officially released, especially after seeing how much love the 3 singles received. i moved to SF last october and am still settling in but man does living in a walkable city make a huge difference. i also picked up the piano around that time and now i'm able to play a few songs, looking into lessons this year.

            i've got a ton more i want to discuss but it's getting late so i'll save it for upcoming posts. the start of a new year always feels fresh and i'm glad the site is back in action. we'll be chatting again real soon, promise :)

            i had my first official release on spotify yesterday. 'copenhagen' is the first single off a new ep (maybe album) that i've been working on called 'overseas'. its an ambient house / tech house project that focuses heavily on creating an atmosphere for the listener to exist in. with droning synths and stripped down drums overseas sounds like an empty parking lot at midnight, barren and desolate yet somewhat peaceful and meditative. its some of my favorite music to date and i'm currently trying to flesh out the project with some extra tracks while keeping the vision very coherent.

            aside from that i've been working to re-imagine album covers for some of my previous work. still trying to figure out how to fit in coding projects. for the first time in a while i have a bunch of small things i want to create, its just that finding the time can be difficult.

            today is one of the best days i've had in years. its beautiful weather, the sun is shining and the sky is a deep deep blue. i picked up <i>the power of now</i> by eckhart tolle and it seems we may have another book for the club. theres still a post or two to be written about <i>the stronghold</i>, that will come in due time, but for now i wanted to highlight just how lucky i feel to be alive today.
            <Break/>
            theres this song from my childhood, 'great day to be alive' by travis tritt. i remember my dad playing it out the radio on warm summer weekends while he washed the cars or landscaped. looking back i feel so indescribably lucky to grow up the way i did. my parents did such a good job of teaching me how to manuever through the ups and downs of life. even aside from that i feel lucky to be who i am, someone who's able to shake things off easily and see the best in most scenes.

            i admit this post is a bit out of place but i needed to tell someone, write it down somewhere, because i am feeling the best i have in ages. love you guys, book club soon :)

            i've been hesitant to release these site changes because they shift away from my initial design for the desktop view. however, as i was working to flesh out the individual album pages i realized that having the website be a static width (visually speaking) with the top bar always spanning the entire screen caused some serious design headaches for laying out content. for one, screen size would drastically impact the viewing experience of the website. secondly, a wider screen meant content felt stretched thin; this was especially apparent on the home page where certain blog posts would have paragraphs barely spanning one line.
            <Break/>
            so the solution is to shift the orientation of the website. i accomplished this by reworking the top navigation bar into a side bar that sits on the left side of the screen. the large plus logo now opens a drawer menu that allows for site navigation and i really like this changes as it parallels the mobile ui's similar design choice. i do think that while this new design looks (very) good, it does lose a little of the sauce that the original design had, which is why it took me a week or two to decide whether or not to go through with the changes. after reflecting though i think the benefits of the new orientation out weigh the loss of sauce, and therefor with this post i will be deploying the new ui.

            it has been a little since the last discussion post and, to be completely honest, i was planning to recap chapters 10-20 all together, but after rereading the material i think these first 6 deserve their own entry. the previous chapter ended with drogo deciding to stay at the fortezza, and we open to him returning to his room more or less justifying to himself that he had made the right decision to say. he speaks about this things that had originally bothered him,
            <Break/>
            <Quote>the crack in the ceiling over his bed ... the dripping cistern ... the sag his body hollowed out in the mattress ... the blankets that felt so inhospitable in the early days.</Quote>
            <Break/>
            and how over time he had not only grown accustom but had become actually quite fond of them.
            <Break/>
            <Quote>all these things had now become drogo's and to leave them would have caused him pain</Quote>
            <Break/>
            i find this excerpt interesting because that seems to always be the case. for me it was the subpar conditions of the college dorms i lived in, or the poor weather of the town i grew up in; these things become precious in a strange way.
            <Break/>
            moving to the next chapter we pick up with drogo <u>two years</u> later. he has a strange dream about augustina (another officer at the fortezza) that heavily foreshadows some events to come. the next day while out at the furthest redoubt they spot a horse crossing the desert to the north. this spirals into a big climax at the end of the chapter where a soldier gets caught between doing his duty or helping his friend. he's bound by rules to take aim against his comrade who is approaching the fortezza at night after retrieving the horse. i love how buzzati describes this scene
            <Break/>
            <Quote>the sentry, however, was no longer moretto. he was simply a sentry with a hard face who had raised his rifle and was now taking aim against a friend. without turning lazzari retreated several steps, stumbling on the stones. "it's me, lazzari!" he shouted. "don't you see it's me? don't shoot, moretto!". but the sentry was no longer the moretto who would frankly joke with his colleagues. he was just a sentry at the fortezza, wearing a uniform made from dark blue cloth with a leather bandolier, absolutely identical to every other sentry in the night</Quote>
            <Break/>
            buzzati's interjection of small details during these tense scenes, like the description of the soldier's uniform during the heat of this moment, adds to both the imagery and suspense. it's like he is toying with the reader, always keeping the resolution just a few words away.
            <Break/>
            the last thing i want to discuss takes place near the end of chapter 15 and brings drogo's dream from chapter 12 to fruition. the tldr is that augustina is too stubborn to stay alive, and dies playing a game of cards <b>by himself</b> on an exposed mountaintop during a snowstorm just to prove a point to opposing forces that their spirits are not broken despite not reaching the summit. reading that aloud this scenario seems hilarious but the way buzzati paints the scene is both moving and heartbreaking all at once. the imagery he invokes is incredible, likening augstinas situation to that of a painting in the fortezza.
            <Break/>
            <Quote>an old painting that hung in the hall at the fortezza represented the end of the prince sebastiano. the prince lay in the heart of the forest mortally wounded, leaning his back against a tree, his head slumped slightly to one side, his cloak falling in harmonious folds. nothing in the image evoked the brutal physical cruelty of death... the painter had completely preserved the prince's nobility and extreme elegance. agustina had now begun to resemble prince sebastiano.</Quote>
            <Break/>
            the fact it takes about 2 and half pages for him to die is the hardest part. captain monty is watching augstina in awe the entire time, pleading him to come back under the shelter, but in the end he does nothing to help him. augustina dies there on the mountain top, encased in snow and ice, leaned against a boulder with a "thin smile on his lips".

            been spending a lot of time irl these past two weekends catching up with some good friends and doing things away from the computer. i did make some major site changes last weekend but haven't pushed them yet since they completely overhaul the desktop interface and are still a few stages away from finished.

            music has been the highlight though - about a week and a half ago i finally tapped into this sound i have been chasing for like a year so. if you know me at all i've probably tried to show you my favorite artist 'cult member' and after months of taking bits and pieces from his music i finally sat down and tried to make a full on song. the final product turned out so good it immediately became a 3 track ep and i gotta say this is probably some of my best work yet (although i may be a bit biased). super excited to share what with you all but first... we must go <b>deeper</b>.
            <Break/>
            <i>deeper still</i> is a 4 song ambient breaks / jungle ep i put together during the february-march timeframe of this year. it started as a composition study, trying to better understand how songs are layed out and progress, but ended up as a concept ep about a group of explorers a hundred years from now venturing deep into the earths crust on a globally funded expedition. the full story can be found on the album page (whenever i get around to making it) or in the album + song descriptions found on soundcloud. the big news regarding <i>deeper still</i> is that i just finished uploading it on distrokid, and it should be available on major streaming services april 30th. this is my first ever release on a major platform and im half ecstatic half petrified as to how it will turn out. i'm kinda hoping it flops so i can learn the process of editing / revising / reuploading tracks through distrokid while the stakes are low.

            i wanted to hop on for a second just to update you all quick. the website is a go for launch, im just in the process of picking out what domain extension to purchase. i've narrowed it down to the following 3 options

            i have no idea how to pick from these remaining few, and i think part of the issue is that this website is supposed to be both a creative and professional portfolio - so the idea of appealing to that broad of an audience is making this decision extra difficult.

            on a side note: gain.online is taken but i have not given up hope. i emailed the company currently using that domain to see if they're open to selling, fingers crossed on that.

            yea well that broke every single button on the app, but only in production *facepalm*. i'm pretty sure the issue has to do with the previous page not unmounting since i was not setting any content until after running a useEffect hook that checks if it should render mobile (useEffects will only run after the component has finished mounted). the result was the page would not update until you manually refreshed it. this couldn't stay for obvious reasons, so if you ever see the desktop site render on mobile pretend like you didn't.

            i was recommended dino buzzati's <i><u>the stronghold</u></i> by my sister who just finished reading it this past weekend. she's a much more avid reader than myself and as such her recommendations always seem to resonate with me. in fact she originally introduced me to paulo cuelo through <i><u>the alchemist</u></i> which had a lasting impact on my life and resulted in me reading a large part of cuelo's collection. Back to <i>the stronghold</i>, this post will cover chapters 1-9.
            <Break />
            my initial impression of buzzati's writing style (and lawrence ventui's translation by extension) is mixed positive. their use of imagery is awesome, and i especially love the description of nighttime both at the stronghold and in the city. some great excerpts include:

                at that hour, they were thinking, a fine mist must have materialized and the lamps were casting a tenuous, yellowish light ... shadowy couples sauntered down solitary streets and you could hear coachmen shouting ... echos of violins and laughter, women's voices in the dark ... it was a city made fascinating by thier youthful dreams, by its still-unknown adventures.

            <Break/>
            on multiple occasions buzzati refers to the night as "deep" and i love it. i remember being a kid biking around the town i grew up in with my friends. the night held this heavy quietness that made it feel like we were the only people left awake in a sleeping world. 'deep' perfectly encapsulates this feeling, and also happens to be a word i have been interested in artistically as of late.
            <Break />
            buzzati's description of life is beautifully tragic as well. there is a passage at the end of chapter 6 that is heart-wrenching. i wont include it here (mainly due to length) but he creates this illustration of growing up through youth and into adulthood as a run that starts so freeing. suddenly there is this creeping feeling that time is closing in on you, friends go on ahead or get left behind, and it's followed by a crushing realization that

            there are many points in this book so far that buzzati goes on a tear; a tangent that he hits with such perfect literary finesse that it resonates without feeling like he's droning on. i really admire that about his writing. thats something that i feel applies to all kinds of art, especially music. tapping into that resonate feeling and driving it home the perfect amount.
            <Break />
            last thing i want to touch on in this post is the 'twist' at the end of chapter 9. i knew it was coming, that it had to happen for the story to progress but the slow buildup during the scene was so so good. in the doctors office, mere moments away from getting his note approving his leave and yet drogo (the mc) is so caught up in the beauty of soldiers and the fortezza, the mountains and sky, his 'destiny' that was 'pressing him from the north' and it climaxes in him declining the medical exit. buzzati revealed what was going to happen without diminishing the impact of it actually occurring. wonderfully done.
            <Break />
            excited to have the first one of these done, it was pretty fun to write too if im being honest. reflection is something we could all use a bit more of. chat soon yea? :)

            weekends are passing at an extraordinary pace this month. last week i was in los angeles for a family gathering, this weekend im headed to boston for a friends birthday. the mobile site is coming along really well actually. im happy with the design so far and its giving me a change to learn new things about nextjs while also refactoring some of the stuff i had previously written. i will say that formatting text for mobile is proving to be more difficult than i had imagined but oh well.

            another thing i wanted to mention was that i've picked up reading again. right now im shooting for a book per month, and i'm thinking about keeping a pseudo book club discussion going with a series of posts - keep an eye out for one later today.

            so i spent the last 2 weeks feverishly playing helldivers 2, and while that game is really great it wasn't great how much of my time it ate up. couple that with my family visiting the bay last week and we have our first missed weekend update of 2024. no new art or (finished) music to show for the past 2 weeks feels bad but there is an upside to this...

            <u>web enhancements</u>
            <Break/>
            time away from my various projects has allowed me to reflect on the direction i am headed. for as proud as i am of what i've accomplished i'm not much closer to publicly sharing any of this work for a few big reasons; the biggest one being that while my webpage looks great on a desktop, 99% of users will be viewing on their phone. therefor the next enhancement to the website will be a mobile version and once that is finished (slated for april 1) i will move to publishing on a real url and sharing on my socials.

            <u>music direction</u>
            <Break/>
            the variety of music i have been exploring lately is really pulling me in opposing directions stylistically. while i think there is overarching themes to my sound regardless of genre, creating separation between them may help with 'brand imaging' or whatever. for that reason i'm going to move most of my jungle / electronic music under a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/deora-ii" target="_blank">new artist name + account</a>. my main account <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gain_online" target="_blank">(gain audio)</a> will then be used for reposting those tracks as well as any artist centric music.

            weeklies were fun but for the next month i am going to be focused on prepping the website for release, music production and physical fitness. there has to be a trade off somewhere and unfortunately i'm suspecting this is where i will take the biggest hit.

            good morning friends! the weather today is nice and sunny, the music has been grooving and i'm excited to share these new works with you all. first up is this porsche 911 in moonstone purple with the targa top. this photo was actually posted by my favorite car photograph syd (@deerfella) on twitter. eventually i'll write up a nice way to embed tweets in these posts but for now just use this ugly <a href="https://twitter.com/deerfella/status/1756375998868722027" target="_blank">hyperlink</a>.

            today is also an especially good day because i have new music to share as well. what started as a joke turned into one of my favorite tracks mainly due to an amazing lead synth. fell in love with the vibe on this track so i spent a solid amount of time making it sound as good as i could. hope you all enjoy.

            i've been thinking a lot about accountability recently. it feels like my entire life (up to fairly recently) i have been running from accountability, sometimes even unknowingly. i'm not a very forward thinking person - i revel in the now, trying to enjoy each moment as much as possible. this approach to life has been fine so far. it has allowed me to leave each phase of my life feeling like i truly did enjoy it to the best of my capability, but now that im in the longest, and dare i say most impactful, phase of life i have been unsatisfied with my ability to achieve goals in both the short and long term.
            <Break/>
            this is where accountability comes into the picture. trying to find ways to effectively hold myself accountable has been at the top of my mind and it seems like i respond well to time-boxed habits. for example, new years resolutions work well for me because i can engrain into my subconcious that for this current year i will do <i>*insert activity*</i> on a given cadence (very much like these weekly updates). this is a great starting point, but evalutating once a year is not often enough to make meaningful progress in the short term.
            <Break/>
            today is chinese new year and i had a revelation. i was thinking to myself "man, a second new years sure is useful. i wish there was a new years every month" and then it hit me: <b><i>why not treat each month like its own year.</i></b> the realization was so simple it felt surreal. i could take a single day each month to reflect upon everything i accomplished in the prior couple weeks then set goals and new resolutions for the coming couple weeks. each month becomes its own experiment where i could try out new routines / habits without the pressure of upholding them for an entire year. the flexibility of adjusting my routine to match artistic / life goals is pretty awesome too.
            <Break/>
            all this to say im excited to start planning life out a bit. im sure we'll chat soon :) and i plan to share each month's goals + resolutions in a post around the 1st from here on out.

            on a music related note my friend invited me to a discord server he created. the plan right now is to post a song per week (perfect with my current schedule) and then talk about the process used / any creative decisions along the way. pretty excited for that since it's been a long time since i've had friends invested in music - miss u noPress!

            i wrote some long winded post about personal things going on in my life but commented it out because i don't think im comfortable sharing those thoughts yet. for now i leave you with this drawing of my friends tacoma, the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gain_online/sets/commuter">official release link</a> of my new ep, and a quote i really needed to reread.

            so theres this new ep i've been working on / hinting at for a couple weeks now. commuter - a mini jazz jungle / breakcore album came about from a one off song that was supposed to be part of the midnight club series.
            {/* <div style={{display: "flex", height: "20rem", margin: "2rem 1rem 2rem 1rem"}}>
                <img src="/art/albums/Commuter Cover.jpg" style={{height: "100%"}} />
            </div> */}
            <Break/>
            the since release single 'tuned in' needed something to fill in the emptiness when the drums were pulled. i decided to throw in an old recording of a houston traffic report and voila, an idea was born. a jungle / breakcore ep centered around the morning commute. it was incredibly fitting since i almost always use my own morning commute to study new music or analize my own tracks. 
            <Break/>
            sound design / scaping for the ep was decidely consistent, using almost exclusively a set of vital presets i've created over the past year, the fl studio stock electric piano, recorded bass guitar (it's been getting better) and of course, the amen + think + funky drummer breaks. this ep was incredibly fun to make and i genuinely feel the limitation of elements really pushed my creativity of how to use those pieces.
            <Break/>
            after commuter i think we'll be locking in for vol 2 of the midnight club series or something similar. i have so many ideas of where i want to take this music, now its just about executing it. steam commuter on soundcloud january 29 - other platforms in however long a release takes.

            you know that feeling when things start to click? creating this week felt super rewarding. pushed out 2 new songs to round out commuter (both hits btw) and ended up with a really nice drawing (shoutout toyota's designers for making a car as gorgeous as the mr2).

            fyi, this soundcloud embed is just an interm solution until i figure out a better way to display

            that i want to get better at in 2024, both personally and artistically, and the key idea that
            persists through both of those catagories is consistency. that is why for the next year i am
            going to make a minimum of 1 song and 1 drawing each week. ill upload them here in a new blog
            post every weekend and maybe even throw in a few thoughts about how my process as a creative
